Create a high-fidelity 'Sun Path' visualization screen for the Solar Tracker.
The screen should show the arc of the sun across the sky for the current date.

**DESIGN SYSTEM (REQUIRED):**
- Platform: Mobile AR, Camera-first
- Theme: Ultra-Minimalist Dark (HUD)
- Background: Full-screen camera view (transparent UI)
- Primary Accent: Electric Orange (#FF6600) for active states
- Text Primary: White (#FFFFFF) Monospace for coordinates
- Font: Clean technical monospace
- Layout: Tactical/HUD orientation (corners and edges)

**Page Structure:**
1. Subtle top readout for 'PATH MODE: ACTIVE'.
2. A very thin, dotted arc representing the sun's trajectory.
3. A glowing orb at the current sun position on the arc.
4. Minimalist legend at the bottom-right explaining the arc colors (daytime vs. twilight).
